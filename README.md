## Project Objective
To create a Social Network API using a NoSQL database, so that the website will handle large amounts of unstructured data; we will be able to add, update, delete and view specific information using the POST, PUT, DELETE AND GET methods. The specific information that we will be manipulating will be a user, a friend for a user, a thought for a user, a reaction for a thought. Also whenever we delete a user, their associated thoughts will do as well! 

## User Story
AS A social media startup, I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database, SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Technologies 
```
Node.js, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose
```

## Installation
You will need to have installed MongoDB and a code editing software of your choice and make your way over to my GitHub Repository where the sorce code will be located at 

## Usage 
To use NoSql Social you will open the project in the code editor of your choice and then open the terminal and type "npm install" or "npm i" to install all the dependencies required. After installing MongoDB, on your terminal or GitBash you will need to type "mongod" to start the server, this will allow you to successfully connect with the database. Finally you will be able to start the project typing "npm start" on your terminal or GitBash. And that is it, now you are able to test the code with insomnia!
